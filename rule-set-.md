Tariff Tantrum: The Drinking Game of Global Retaliation

Players: 3+Supplies:

A globe or world map

A stack of “Tariff Cards” (see included deck or use the digital version)

Drinks (beer, wine, cocktails, your choice)

A gavel, megaphone, or any loud object to announce "TARIFF!"

Optional: fake money or Monopoly bills for added roleplay

Setup

Each player chooses a “country” to represent.

Give each player 5 “Export Tokens” (bottle caps, chips, anything works).

Shuffle the Tariff Deck.

Choose one player to start as the World Trade Arbiter (they moderate the first round).

Sample Tariff Cards

Create cards or use the digital deck. Example cards:

"Country X slaps a 25% tariff on steel from Country Y!"

"Trade deficit scandal! Everyone drinks 2."

"Currency manipulation accusations fly. Roll a die. If even, you retaliate; if odd, you apologize and drink."

"Your prime minister tweets angrily. Random country drinks 1."

"Global summit failure! Everyone drinks."

Game Rules

1. Start of Round

The Arbiter draws a card and reads it aloud. If a country is named, that player responds. If retaliation is allowed, it proceeds clockwise until resolved.

2. Export Token Penalties

If a player loses all export tokens, they enter trade recession. They must chug until a “trade deal” is struck (someone gives them a token or toasts to diplomacy).

3. TARIFF Clause

Any player can yell "TARIFF!" at any time to impose a rule until the end of the round (e.g., “No one can say ‘drink’”). If they mess it up, they drink double.

4. Random Sanctions

Every 4 rounds, flip a coin:

Heads: UN sanctions a random player (they skip a turn)

Tails: WTO meltdown! Everyone drinks

Winning

First player to get rid of all export tokens becomes the Global Trade Hegemon. Everyone else raises a glass and says:“We bend the knee to you, O mighty export overlord.”

Optional Add-ons

Add fake news alerts that reverse a card’s effects

Use the digital deck and implement sound effects

Bonus rule: if someone mentions "Smoot-Hawley"—everyone drinks
